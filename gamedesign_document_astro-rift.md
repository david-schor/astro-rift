# Game Design Document: Astro Rift

## 1. Summary
The game was inspired by the games *Power of Ten*, *Dome Keeper* and *Cozy Space Survivors*.
The aim is to create a simple but entertaining gameplay loop.
The player controls a rocket and has to collect resources from other planets, meteorites, characters etc. and bring them back to his own planet. The aim is to use resources to improve the player's rocket and the defence of their own planet.
The enemies spawn in waves, which means that the player must collect resources during the attack in order not to lose.
The round is over as soon as the **Rift** has been closed.

## 2 Game concept

### 2.1 Theme

The theme of the game is dark in nature and is orientated towards a gloomy atmosphere that takes up elements of games such as *Dome Keeper* and *Power of Ten*. Players are immersed in a world characterised by the loneliness of space and the constant threat of alien forces. The darkness of the cosmos is emphasised by the shining stars and distant galaxies, while the gaming experience is characterised by relentless tension and the pressure to protect one's own planet. Ominous sounds and gloomy graphics reinforce the feeling of isolation and the fight for survival in the infinite expanses of space.

## 3. World

### 3.1 Planets

The planets form the diverse and unexplored environment in which the players move through the universe on their mission. Each planet is unique and offers a unique landscape, resources and potential dangers.

The procedural generation system ensures that no two planets are the same, offering players a constantly changing and challenging experience. From dusty desert worlds to lush jungle planets, players can explore a variety of environments and collect resources to further their mission.

The planets are not only the setting for resource collection, but also home to various alien life forms and potential threats. Players must navigate carefully and act strategically to avoid danger and achieve their goals.

#### 3.1.2 Resource distribution
#### 3.1.3 Dangers

### 3.2 Main base

The main base is the player's centrepiece. Protecting and maintaining it is crucial for survival in the game. If the main base is destroyed, this leads to the immediate failure of the round, which means that all progress is lost and the game must be restarted from the beginning.

At the beginning, the planet only has a simple protective shell, which has no active defence function. It is the player's responsibility to strengthen the main base and equip it with various defence functions to protect it from enemy attacks.

If the player's rocket is destroyed, the player is automatically respawned on the planet. However, any resources previously collected on board the rocket will be lost and drift around the universe. There is also a cooldown period before the new rocket is ready to launch again.

The player has the option of expanding the main base by using resources with various defence functions. These defences can include a variety of defensive measures, from automatic turrets to energised shields that can repel enemy attacks.
